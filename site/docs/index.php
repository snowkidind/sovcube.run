<h2>What is SovCube?</h2>
<p>SovCube offers long-term holders a way to increase their BSOV Token holdings securely over time, with the limitation of gradual withdrawals.</p>             
<p>We also plan to introduce a future governance function, allowing top timelockers to use their locked tokens as voting power. These timelockers will be able to vote on proposals for allocating funds from a decentralized governance treasury and receive voting rewards.</p>

    <!-- Introduction -->
    <section id="introduction">
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
	    The SovCube.com website is a platform that provides access to a collection of timelocking contracts, offering a unique approach to token time-locking.
</p> 
<p>
This documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of SovCube's functionalities, its integration with the BSOV ecosystem,
 and how it enhances token value and stability. Whether you're a new user or an experienced one, this guide will assist you in making the most out of SovCube's features.
</p>

<h3>Why Timelock Tokens?</h3>
<p>
In a crypto landscape plagued by countless rugpulls and uncertainties, we introduce a system that is rugpull-resistant.
Our innovation is not just about security; it's designed to potentially usher in a new era of hyperdeflation.
</p>
<p>
BSOV Token, known for its inherent deflationary nature, forms the cornerstone of this concept.
By introducing SovCube Timelock Rewards and enabling users to lock their tokens, we set in motion a cascade effect.
The circulating supply of BSOV Token will dramatically decrease, potentially reaching unprecedented lows.
</p><p>
In a world where traditional fiat currencies are characterized by inflation or even hyperinflation, we stand in stark contrast.
BSOV Token with SovCube Timelocking is a testament to our commitment to creating a currency that defies the norm, 
offering a secure, anti-inflationary alternative in the cryptocurrency realm.
</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Getting Started with SovCube -->
    <section id="getting-started">
        <h2>Getting Started with SovCube</h2>
        <p>
            Begin your journey with SovCube by setting up your wallet like Metamask and filling it up with BSOV Tokens. 
This section will guide you through connecting your digital wallet, navigating the SovCube interface, 
and understanding the basic functionalities. Learn about the initial steps required to start using SovCube effectively,
 including securing your wallet and understanding the dashboard layout.
        </p>
	<h3>Setup your Metamask Wallet</h3>
	<p>The current user interface of SovCube is only tested using the <a href="https://metamask.io/download/" target="_blank">
Metamask wallet extension</a> on <a href="https://brave.com" target="_blank">Brave Browser</a>,
 so first you will need to download this software and create a new wallet.</p>
<p>
<div class="responsive-iframe">
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YVgfHZMFFFQ?si=jx61uhf4BvfbvnEo" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>
</p>
<p>When creating your Metamask wallet, you will receive a freshly generated mnemonic seed phrase. 
The seed phrase is 12 english words in a specific order. You will need to physically 
write these words down on a piece of paper or two. 
YOU HAVE TO KEEP YOUR SEED PHRASE SAFE! NEVER SEND YOUR SEED PHRASE TO ANYONE, AND NEVER KEEP IT STORED ON YOUR COMPUTER OR ONLINE.</p> 
<p>You can read more about <a href="https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us/articles/360015489531" target="_blank">Getting Started with Metamask</a></p>
	<h3>Buy or transfer BSOV Tokens to your Metamask Wallet</h3>
	<p>After you have setup your Metamask wallet extension, you will need to get yourself ETH for transaction fees, 
and BSOV Tokens. You can either buy ETH and BSOV using the Metamask Wallet, 
or if you have already bought them, you can transfer them from another wallet or cryptocurrency exchange.</p>	
	<h3>How to buy BSOV Tokens</h3>
	<p>First you will need ETH which works as gasoline for the Ethereum Blockchain.
Then you can go to <a target="_blank" href="https://bsovtoken.com/trade">Trade BSOV</a> page, and buy BSOV Tokens. 
With ETH you can send transactions and interact with smart-contracts on Ethereum. 
BSOV Token is a smart-contract built on Ethereum, so you will need ETH to interact with BSOV Token.</p>
	<p>You can see more info about buying BSOV Token at this page:</p>
	</p><a href="https://bsovtoken.com/trade" target="_blank">BSOV Token - Buy, Sell & Trade</a></p>
	<h3>Getting started with SovCube</h3>
	<p>After you have installed Metamask, created your wallet, acquired ETH and BSOV Tokens, 
you now have everything you need to interact with SovCube.</p> 
	<p>First you will need to click "Launch dApp" on the SovCube website.</p>
	<p>Then click the blue button called "Connect to Wallet". This will open a window in your Metamask extension,
 where you will approve connecting your Metamask wallet to the SovCube website.</p>
    </section>


    <section id="">
        <h2>dApp Features</h2>
<p>Read about all the features of the SovCube dApp.</p>

<!-- Time-Locking Tokens -->
<section id="time-locking">
    <h2>Timelocking Tokens</h2>
    <p>
	The "Timelock Tokens" function allows users to lock a specified amount of tokens for a period set by the contract.
If the user timelocks their tokens, the tokens will be locked until the Lock Time has expired. The Lock Time is determined by when the contract was deployed, and the lock time parameter in the contract.
</p><p>
This means that since e.g. Contract 2 has a 1000 day Lock Time and was deployed 15th of February, the timelocked tokens for all users are unlocked 1000 days from the 15th of February.
    </p>
<p>To receive Timelock Rewards, you will need to timelock tokens into <strong>Contract 2</strong>.</p> 
<p>There are no incentives to timelock your tokens into Contract 1.</p>
</section>

<section id="locktime">
<h2>Lock Time</h2>
<p>
Lock Time is a global variable that applies to all users, and is set on the day of the deployment of the contract.
It means that all the users have to wait until the Lock Time expires before they can start withdrawing their tokens, following the weekly withdrawal rate.
</p>
</section>

<section id="regularaccount">
    <h2>Regular Account</h2>
    <p>
        The "Regular Account" is where the user-initiated timelocked balance ends up, so whenever you use the "Timelock" function, the tokens end up here. They are locked until the contracts' Lock Time has expired, and can only be withdrawn according to the weekly withdrawal rate set by the contract.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="incomingaccount">
    <h2>Incoming Tokens Account</h2>
    <p>
        The "Incoming Tokens Account" is where all claimed Timelock Rewards and timelocked tokens that were sent by other users end up. If users send you tokens through the "Send Locked Tokens" function, they end up here, and after you click Accept Incoming Tokens button, they end up here.
</p><p>Note that when accepting incoming tokens, the Lock Time of the Timelocked Tokens in the "Incoming Tokens Account" is reset to 1000 days, regardless of how much time you have left on it.
   </p>
</section>


<!-- Withdrawal Process -->
<section id="withdrawal">
    <h2>Withdrawal Process</h2>
    <p>
	The "Withdrawal Process" enables users to retrieve their locked tokens after the Lock Time has expired.
 This function provides a seamless way to unlock and access the previously timelocked tokens, making them available for further use or transfer.</p>
<h3>Withdrawal Rate:</h3>
When the Lock Time has expired, the users can begin withdrawing their tokens, but they do have to follow the weekly Withdrawal Rate.
For example, if you timelock 10,000 tokens in Contract 2, which has a 100 tokens/week withdrawal rate; it will take 100 weeks to withdraw all those tokens, providing that you withdraw once every week.
<p>
<strong>Contract 1</strong> has a weekly withdrawal rate of 1000 tokens.
    </p>
<p>
<strong>Contract 2</strong> has a weekly withdrawal rate of 100 tokens, and also has an additional account called "Incoming Tokens Account", that shares the same weekly withdrawal rate as the Regular Account.
</p>
</section>

<section id="unclaimed">
    <h2>Unclaimed Timelock Rewards</h2>
    <p>
	"Unclaimed Timelock Rewards" is a balance that represents rewards that users have earned but have not yet claimed.
 You gain tokens to this balance whenever you timelock tokens with Contract 2. To claim tokens from this balance, you will need to press the "Claim Timelock Rewards" button.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="claimrewards">
    <h2>Claim Timelock Rewards</h2>
    <p>
	The "Claim Timelock Rewards" button allows users to retrieve and claim rewards from the "Unclaimed Timelock Rewards" balance, that are earned through timelocking tokens in Contract 2.
After you click this button, the balance of "Unclaimed Timelock Rewards" will be transferred to the "Incoming Tokens" balance.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="acceptincoming">
    <h2>Accept Incoming Tokens</h2>
    <p>
	"Accept Incoming Tokens" is a button that refers to the process of receiving tokens after claiming the Timelock Rewards or if you have been sent timelocked tokens from  other users who used the "Send Locked Tokens" function.
</p><p>After clicking "Accept Incoming Tokens" button, the balance in "Incoming Tokens" will be transferred to the "Timelocked Tokens" balance in the "Incoming Tokens Account".
</p><p>After the tokens have been transferred, the Lock Time of the "Incoming Tokens Account" will reset to the initial 1000 days, regardless of how much time you have left of your Lock Time in the Incoming Tokens Account. 
    </p>
</section>


<section id="sendlocked">
    <h2>Send Locked Tokens</h2>
    <p>
	"Send Locked Tokens" allows users to transfer tokens that they have already timelocked in their regular account. The locked tokens are sent to the "Incoming Tokens" balance of the recipient users you send it to.
They can only access these tokens after clicking the "Accept Incoming Tokens" button, and after they have waited the initial 1000 days that are set after accepting.
<p>
You may send timelocked tokens to several different addresses, and several different amounts in a single transaction.
To send timelocked tokens to several different addresses with several different amounts, you would need to enter one address per line, and one amount per line.
</p><p>The amounts and addresses correspond to the line they are at.
</p> <p>
 For example, if line 1 is [ADDRESS1] and line 2 is [ADDRESS2] 
<br>and then in the amounts field you type in line 1 [200] and line 2 [500],
<br> it means that 200 tokens will be sent to [ADDRESS1] and 500 tokens will be sent to [ADDRESS2].
</p>

        <h2>Smart Contract Details</h2>
        <p>
            Dive into the technical aspects of SovCube with an overview of its smart contracts. 
This section is designed for users interested in understanding the contract mechanics, 
featuring explanations of contract functions, security measures, and how to interact with them directly for advanced operations.
        </p>


<section id="contract-1" class="table-section">
    <h2>Contract 1 Details</h2>
<p><strong>Contract 1</strong> was deployed the 2nd of August, 2019, and had only a 180 days lock time, which expired the 29th of January, 2020.
Contract 1 has a weekly withdrawal rate of 1000 tokens per week, but even so, very few tokens have been withdrawn as of writing this (17th of January, 2024).
You can still timelock tokens in Contract 1, but there is no incentive to do so.

    <h2>Rewards Reserve Contract Details</h2>
<p>The Rewards Reserve Contract is a contract that interacts with Contract 2 and acts as a reserve for the Timelock Rewards. 300,000 BSOV Tokens have been deposited by the creator of SovCube, and these tokens are designated for the users of SovCube. This contract fetches the amount of tokens that have been timelocked in Contract 2, and calculates how many Timelock Rewards should be sent to the users.</p>

        <p>
            Find quick answers to common questions about SovCube in this comprehensive FAQ section. 
It covers a wide range of topics, from basic queries to more complex issues, helping you resolve common problems and understand SovCube's operations better.
        </p>
	<h3>Question: Will I get dividends from timelocking my tokens in SovCube?</h3>
<p>Yes, we call them Timelock Rewards. If you timelock your BSOV Tokens in Contract 2, you will receive Timelock Rewards. The earliest users will double their BSOV investment.</p>
<h3>Question: Is timelocking the same as staking?</h3>
<p>
No, in SovCube we do not stake; we timelock and receive Timelock Rewards!
Timelocking involves voluntarily locking your tokens for a specific duration, accompanied by a Slow-Release mechanism with a predetermined withdrawal rate per week. Unlike staking, SovCube does not support traditional staking practices, where tokens are deposited to earn dividends and can be withdrawn at any time or in a very short period.
In SovCube, Timelocks are intended for more extended durations, and the associated Timelock Rewards remain secured and inaccessible for 1000 days after being claimed and accepted by the user.

        <h2>BSOV Token</h2>
	<p>
BSOV Token is a deflationary and PoW-mineable ERC20 token that was created in June, 2019.
BSOV Token's transaction burn of 1% encourages holding and is part of its deflationary mechanism.
SovCube interacts with BSOV Token and uses it as its base currency for timelocking and Timelock Rewards.</p>
<p>
A lot of the BSOV Token supply is locked in SovCube, making BSOV Token even more deflationary.
Another thing that makes BSOV Token even more deflationary is that the PoW-mining has stopped
 due to a "Bricking-bug" in the smart-contract code of BSOV, that completely stopped PoW-mining forever.
You can read more about the "Bricking-bug" <a target="_blank" href="https://real-rouse.medium.com/bsov-token-has-stopped-minting-new-tokens-20b19bbf5eae">here</a>.

// Welcome to Sovcube's TimeLock & Rewards Contract
// https://SovCube.com
// 
//
// DO NOT SEND TOKENS DIRECTLY TO THIS CONTRACT!!!
// THEY WILL BE LOST FOREVER!!!
// YOU HAVE TO MAKE A CALL TO THE CONTRACT TO BE ABLE TO TIMELOCK & WITHDRAW!!!
//
// This contract timelocks BSOV Tokens for 1000 days from the day the contract is deployed.
// Tokens can be timelocked within that period without resetting the timer.
// The timelocked tokens will be sent to the user's "Regular Account"
//
// Once the users have timelocked their tokens, they are able to send locked tokens to anyone,
// they can even batch several addresses and amounts into one "SendLockedTokens" transaction. 
// If you receive timelocked tokens from someone, they will be sent to your "Untaken Incoming Balance".
// If you accept the incoming tokens using the "acceptUntakenIncomingTokens" method, the Lock Time of your Incoming Tokens Account will reset to 1000 days.
//
// After the globalLockExpirationDateRegularAccount is reached, users can withdraw tokens with a rate limit to prevent all holders
// from withdrawing and selling at the same time. The limit is 100 BSoV per week per user once the 1000 days is hit.

/*
The additional function of this smart-contract is to act as a Timelock Rewards reserve/treasury and distributor of timelocked tokens to users to timelock their BSOV Tokens.
It interacts with a timelocking contract (timelockContract).
